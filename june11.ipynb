    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are typically used when you need a simple function for a short period of time, and you don't want to define a separate named function for it. They are commonly used in functional programming and in situations where you need to pass a function as an argument to another function.\n",
    "Lambda functions differ from regular functions in a few key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lambda functions are anonymous: They don't have a name, unlike regular functions which are defined with the 'def keyword and have a name assigned to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lambda functions are single- expression functions: They can only contain a single expression, which is evaluated and returned. In contrast, regular functions can contain multiple statements and have a return statement to specify the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lambda functions are typically used as function literals: They are\n",
    "defined and used in the same place without assigning them to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the difference between a lambda function and a regular function:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Regular function return x ^ **2\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lambda function\n",
    "\n",

    "print(lambda_square(5))\n",
    "\n",
    "#0\n",
    "\n",
    "#0\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both the 'square\n",
    "\n",
    "function and the lambda_square lambda function calculate the square of a number. However, the lambda function is defined inline without a name, whereas the regular function is defined using the def keyword and assigned a name\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2\n",
    "Yes, a lambda function in Python can have multiple arguments. You can define and use multiple arguments in a lambda function by separating them with commas, just like in a regular function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the syntax for defining a lambda function with multiple arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda argument1, argument 2,\n",
    "You can specify any number of arguments in the lambda function based on your requirements. The arguments are separated by commas and can be of any valid data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates a lambda function with multiple arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lambda function with multipl multiply lambda x, y: x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "result = multiply(5, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result) # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the lambda function 'multiply takes two arguments 'x' and y and returns their product. When we call the lambda function with multiply(5, 3), it multiplies 5 and 3 and returns the result, which is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend this concept to any number of arguments by including them in the lambda function definition and accessing them within the expression.\n",
    "Q3\n",
    "Lambda functions in Python are typically used in situations where you need a small, anonymous function for a short period of time. They are commonly used in conjunction with other functions that accept function objects as arguments. Lambda functions provide a concise and inline way to define these small functions without the need for explicitly naming them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use case for lambda\n",
    "\n",
    "->\n",
    "One common use case for lambda functions is with higher-order functions like map(), 'filter()', and reduce(), which expect a function as one of their arguments. Lambda functions can be used to define these functions on the fly without the need for separate function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example use case where a lambda function is used with the map() function to apply a transformation to a list of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "=\n",

    "# Convert the map object to a result = list(squared_numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: [1,\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the lambda function `lambda x x ** 2 is used as the first argument to 'map(). It squares each element in the numbers list and returns a map object. We convert the map object to a list using `list() and store the result in the 'result' variable. The resulting list\n",
    "`list() and store the result in the 'result' variable. The resulting list contains the squared numbers `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25].\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are also commonly used in sorting and key extraction tasks, especially when you need to define custom sorting criteria or extract specific properties from objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, lambda functions provide a concise and convenient way to define small, anonymous functions for immediate use in various contexts where function objects are required..\n",
    "Q4\n",
    "Lambda functions in Python offer several advantages and have some limitations compared to regular functions. Let's explore them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Concise syntax: Lambda functions allow you to define simple functions in a compact and inline manner, without the need for a full function definition. This can make the code more concise and\n",
    "straightforward operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anonymous nature: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't require a formal name. This is advantageous when you need a function for a specific purpose and don't want to clutter your code with a separate function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional programming: Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms, where functions are treated as first-class citizens. They are particularly useful when working with higher-order functions like 'map().\n",
    "'filter(), and reduce ()^ * allowing for more expressive and functional programming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single expression limitation: Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can't contain multiple statements or complex logic. If you need to perform more complex operations or include control flow statements, a regular function with a 'def statement is more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limited readability: While lambda functions can make code more concise, excessive use of complex lambda functions can decrease\n",
    "code readability. They are best suited for simple, one-line operations. If the logic becomes too complex, it is better to use a regular function with a descriptive name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lack of documentation and testability: Lambda functions lack the ability to include drawstring for documenting their purpose and usage. Additionally, they can be challenging to test independently since they are usually used in an inline manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging limitations: When using lambda functions, error messages may refer to the lambda expression itself rather than the specific line within the expression\n",
    "This can make debugging more challenging compared to regular functions, which have named lines and functions for error identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lambda functions provide a concise and anonymous way to define small functions, making them suitable for certain use cases, such as working with higher-order functions or performing simple operations. However, for more complex operations, code readability, documentation, and testability, regular functions with a full def statement are often preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5\n",
    "Yes, lambda functions in Python have access to variables defined outside of their own scope. This concept is known as \"lexical scoping\" or \"closure.\" Lambda functions can access and use variables from the enclosing scope in which they are defined.\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the access of variables from the outer scope within a lambda function:\n",
    "def outer function():\n",
    "\n",
